## Instruction

This website is built using `hugo` theme with `Stack`, a faster static website generator.

This is a gift for my lover who is a knowledge sharing blog to build a nest for her on the Internet.

It is because of the following open-source project that we have our own website.

-   [hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
-   [stack](https://stack.jimmycai.com/)

Welcome to our official website [yujianxiaoling.com](https://yujianxiaoling.com) .

For more information, please refer to blog articles [Infiling](https://iofomo.com/infiling) .
